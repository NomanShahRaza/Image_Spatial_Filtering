# Image Spatial Filtering

Filtering is a technique for modifying or enhancing an image. Spatial domain operation or filtering (the processed value for the current pixel depends on both itself and surrounding pixels). Hence Filtering is a neighborhood operation, in which the value of any given pixel in the output image is determined by applying some algorithm to the values of the pixels in the neighborhood of the corresponding input pixel. A pixel's neighborhood is some set of pixels, defined by their locations relative to that pixel. 

##  1. Smoothing Spatial Filter
Smoothing filter is used for blurring and noise reduction in the image. Blurring is pre-processing steps for removal of small details and Noise Reduction is accomplished by blurring.
